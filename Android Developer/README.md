## 1.Choose an IDE

- Android Studio
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Eclipse
- NetBeans
- Komodo

## 2. Pick a language

- Java
- Kotlin

## 3. Get familiar with the anatomy of an app

### Activity:

- Activity life cycle
- Handle Activity State Changes
- Understand Tasks and Back Stack
- Processes and Application Lifecycle

### Services:

- Types of Android Services
- The Life Cycle of Android Services

### Content Provider:

- Content URI
- Operations in Content Provider
- Working of the Content Provider
- Creating a Content Provider

### Broadcast Receiver:

- Implicit Broadcast Exceptions

## 4. Learn the basics of UI

- TextView
- Button
- ImageView
- EditText
- CheckBox
- Spinner
- RecyclerView

## 5. Learn the paradigm of asynchronous programming

- Android service
- Callbacks
- Reactive programming (like RxJava or RxKotlin)
- Kotlin coroutines

## 6. Choose where to store your data

- Room Database – the database object provides the interface to the underlying SQLite database. An application should only have one room database instance, which may then be used to access multiple database tables.
- Data Access Object (DAO) – contains the SQL statements required to insert, retrieve and delete data within the SQLite database.
- Entities – typically a data class that defines the schema for a table within the database and defines the table name, column names, and data types, and identifies which column is to be the primary key.

## 8. Connect your app to the internet

- Retrofit
- Gson

## 9. Choose the right application architecture

- MVVM
- MVP
- MVC
- VIPER

## 10. Don’t forget to test your code

#### Types of tests on Android

- Functional testing
- Performance testing
- Accessibility testing
- Compatibility testing

## Conclusion
I covered all the major sections that are gonna help you become an Android developer

Of course, that was just the basic explanation of main topics like activities and fragments.

The learning curve at the beginning will be hard. You will continuously learn and explore new possibilities with different programming concepts and programming paradigms such as reactive programming.
