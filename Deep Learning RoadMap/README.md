# Complete Roadmap for Deep Learning

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning and artificial intelligence that uses advanced computations to model the structure and operation of the neural networks in the human brain. In order to automatically extract and learn complicated representations of data patterns, hierarchical features, and complex abstractions from large-scale datasets, it revolves around training and using deep artificial neural networks, which are typically made up of multiple layers of interconnected nodes or artificial neurons.

## Applications of Deep Learning
Deep learning has various applications specially in this day and age as it is growing day by day there is so much to explore.

  Some of the commonly used applications that are commonly known are: 
- Natural Lnaguage Processing
