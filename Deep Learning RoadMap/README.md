# Complete Roadmap for Deep Learning

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning and artificial intelligence that uses advanced computations to model the structure and operation of the neural networks in the human brain. In order to automatically extract and learn complicated representations of data patterns, hierarchical features, and complex abstractions from large-scale datasets, it revolves around training and using deep artificial neural networks, which are typically made up of multiple layers of interconnected nodes or artificial neurons.

## Skills needed to be acquired 
An effective machine learning method is deep learning. Consequently, developing deep learning models calls for extensive machine learning expertise. Let's examine some of the crucial abilities you'll require to master deep learning:


# 1. Basic Mathematical skills
  Understanding how deep learning algorithms function requires a solid foundation in mathematics, particularly statistics. 
    Some of the requitred mathematical skills are:
- Linear Algebra
- Probability Theory
- Statistics  
- Calculus
- Algorithms

```

- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Neural networks are the foundation of deep learning. 

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): CNNs are widely used for image recognition and computer vision tasks. 

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): RNNs are designed to process sequential data, such as natural language or time series data, by utilizing feedback connections.

- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): LSTMs are a type of RNN that addresses the vanishing gradient problem. 

- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that are trained in an adversarial manner. 

- Autoencoders: Autoencoders are neural networks trained to reconstruct their input data at the output layer.

- Deep Belief Networks (DBN): DBNs are composed of multiple layers of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and can be used for unsupervised pre-training or as generative models.

- Reinforcement Learning (RL): Although not exclusive to deep learning, RL algorithms can benefit from deep neural networks as function approximators.
