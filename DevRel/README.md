> DevRel is the marketing technique used to ensure that one's company, products, and developers establish a good, continuous relationship with external developers through mutual communication.


## Why we need DevRel?

Why did DevRel become so significant? DevRel became significant because advertisements were not originally designed with developers in mind. As a result, the products and services developed would not reach them. Marketing is used to ensure that one's products and services are delivered to their intended audience. Marketing that does not reach developers is meaningless.

As a result, relevant marketing strategies developed with developers as users became known as DevRel.
