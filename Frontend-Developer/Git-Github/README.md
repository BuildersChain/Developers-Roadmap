# Git-Github

## Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system that helps keep track of changes in your code, manage different versions of your code and collaborate with other developers. GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, allowing developers to share their code, collaborate, and keep track of their work.

## Setting up a repository on GitHub

* Create a GitHub account
* Create a new repository by clicking on the "New repository" button.
* Choose a name and description for your repository, and select the type of repository you want to create.
* Initialize your repository with a README file, if you wish.
* Clone the repository to your local machine by copying the repository URL.
* Type in the command "git clone [repository URL]" to clone the repository.
* Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory you want to keep your code.


## Basic Git Commands

* `git `status` - This shows the status of your local repository.
* `git clone [repository link]` - Clone the forked copy of the project.
* `git branch [branch name]` - Creates a new branch.
* `git checkout -b [your branch name]` - Creates a new branch and also checks out in that as well.
* `git add [file name]` - Adds the specified file to the repository.
* `git commit -m "[commit message]"` - Commits the changes to the repository with a message describing the changes.
* `git push origin [branch name]` - Pushes the changes to the specified branch on GitHub.
* `git pull origin [branch name]` - Pulls the latest changes from the specified branch on GitHub to your local repository.

## Collaborating on GitHub

* Fork the repository you want to collaborate on.
* Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
* Create a new branch to work on.
* Make changes to the code and push the changes to your forked repository.
* Submit a pull request to the original repository, describing the changes you have made.
* The repository owner will review the changes and merge them into the original repository if they are approved.
