# Angular
Angular is an open-source JavaScript framework for building client-side web applications. It was developed and is maintained by Google. Angular is a complete rewrite of AngularJS, which was the first version of the framework.

## Advantages of Angular
* Modular architecture - Angular is designed with a modular architecture that enables developers to build complex applications in a modular and maintainable way.

* Two-way data binding - Angular's two-way data binding makes it easy to keep the data model and the view in sync, which reduces the amount of boilerplate code required to create dynamic user interfaces.

* Dependency injection - Angular's dependency injection system makes it easy to manage dependencies in your application and to write testable code.

* TypeScript - Angular is written in TypeScript, which adds type checking and other advanced features to JavaScript, making it more robust and easier to maintain.

* Large community and ecosystem - Angular has a large and active community of developers, which means there are many resources available, such as tutorials, libraries, and tools.
