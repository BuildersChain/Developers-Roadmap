# mostly setup is the most difficult so here are the steps
# flutter setup
1. install flutter, set path in enviroment variables of bin
# https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
1. then install android studio
# https://developer.android.com/studio
1. install latest sdk and also cmline tools when opening android studio first time
1. setup virtual device in android studio settings->device manager->new device
1. go to environment variables -> system-> path->paste sdk path
1. run flutter doctor in cmd
see if any errors
if error of android toolchain,
go to android studio installation path by cd then run -> mklink /D "jre" "jbr" -> this will create a symbolic link so sdk will be able to run required dependancies from jbr
if any error of flutter sdk then -> make sure flutter/bin is added into path environment variables
if any error of cmake,  make sure simple visual studio is installed with cmake package
