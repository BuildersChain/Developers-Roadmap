# Full stack Development

## Getting Started with Full stack Development
Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development, including the front end and back end. The front end consists of the user interface, and the back end takes care of the business logic and application workflows.In this guide, we'll cover the basic steps to get started with Full stack development, including the different frameworks or tech stacks you can learn, and the related study resources.

## Prerequisites
Before you start with Full stack development, you should have a fairly good understanding of both frontend and backend development.We have already created roadmaps for both frontend and backend development.

* [Backend roadmap](https://github.com/WeMakeDevs/roadmaps/tree/main/Backend-Development)


## Learn Typescript
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.Think of it as javascript but with type safety.

## Learn Advance GitHub Features
It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects.Learning advance features will help you collaborating more effeciently with other fellow developers.

## Learn about Cloud service providers
Cloud service providers are companies that establish public clouds, manage private clouds, or offer on-demand cloud computing components (also known as cloud computing services) like Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service(SaaS). Cloud services can reduce business process costs when compared to on-premise IT.

## Learn GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
