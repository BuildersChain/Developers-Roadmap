## Getting Started with Full stack Development
Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development, including the front end and back end. The front end consists of the user interface, and the back end takes care of the business logic and application workflows.In this guide, we'll cover the basic steps to get started with Full stack development, including the different frameworks or tech stacks you can learn, and the related study resources.

## Prerequisites
