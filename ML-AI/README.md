# Complete Roadmap for Data Science, ML and AI

As we know Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are hot topics nowadays, but few are telling you the exact path to cover or learn things in a simple way. So that’s why we cover all the paths for you to become an expert in the domain. So let’s get started!

## 1. Python Programming

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. we can say that it is a technique to Analyze or visualize data in a much efficient way so that it makes a more meaningful.

## 3. Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.

Techniques:
- Handling Missing Value
- Handling Outlier
- Categorical Encoding
- Normalization and Standardization

## 4. Feature Selection

In machine learning and statistics, feature selection, also known as variable selection, attribute selection, or variable subset selection, is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. Simply we can say that to select the right feature for our machine learning model.

Techniques:
- Correlation
- Forward Elimination or Backward Elimination
- Univariate selection
- Random forest importance
- Feature Selection with Decision Tree

## 5. Machine Learning

Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.

Supervised Learning algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge and Lasso Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGboost
- Adaboost
- Gradient Boosting
- Catboost
- Light-Gbm

Unsupervised Learning algorithms:
- K-means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DB-scan Clustering
- Silhouette Clustering

## 6. Hyperparmameter Tuning

In machine learning, hyperparameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. By contrast, the values of other parameters (typically node weights) are learned.

Techniques:
- Grid Search-cv
- Randomized search-cv
- Hyperopt
- Optuna
- Genetic Algorithm

## 7. Docker

Docker is a set of the platform as service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

## 8. Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
