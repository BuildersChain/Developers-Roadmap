## Roadmap to deep dive into Blockchain
**Its not surprising to see the growth in blockchain or Web3 space.** It offers so many features those were not in the earlier webs (web1.0 and web2.0), Indeed, Blockchain is one of the top emerging technology domains in the present scenario of **Tech industry**. And as a result we have massive demand for blockchain developers. So don't u think this is the right time to deep dive into this field.

If yes then you're on the right placeðŸ˜ŽðŸš€ This blog is written by an intension to provide all the crucial details that are required for folks to deep dive into this industry, so without further delay let's get in!!

## Why we need Blockchain?
Blockchain technology integrates a peer to peer network between a large number of computers of users where each user's system acts like a node and hence these computers collectively work together and build an integrated network which eliminate the **centralized** web and offers **decentralized** working.

</p>

This Decentralized network eliminates the third party and makes the whole working of the web much more **transparent!**

> Blockchain Developers can be classified into two types- Blockchain Software Developer and Core Blockchain Developers. Now let's take a look at the roles and responsibilities
<a href="https://github.com/"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73097560/115834477-dbab4500-a447-11eb-908a-139a6edaec5c.gif"></a>

### Core Blockchain Developer:
- Design and monitors the network architecture
- Implement various blockchain features & functionality
- Design the Blockchain protocols and consensus protocols.

### Blockchain Software Developer 
- Develops APIs for Blockchain integration.
- Develop & Implement Smart Contracts, etc.
- Develop the frontend and backend of Decentralized Applications.

> _Now as you've got through some basic knowledge of Blockchain and their job profiles. Now let's see how can you jump into this field and become a successful Blockchain Engineer._

### 1. Learn about Computer Science fundamentals.
Before going much deeper into blockchain and writing code, You should acquire knowledge of Computer Science fundamentals like: **Databases and their Management, Computer Networks and Protocols, Operating Systems, Object Oriented Programming and Etc.**

For this below are some resources to learn about them thoroughly:

* [Computer Science fundaments](https://engineering-computer-science.wright.edu/computer-science-and-engineering/computer-science-fundamentals-course-cs5160)
* [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
* [Best way to learn CS fundamentals](https://medium.com/javarevisited/8-best-computer-science-courses-for-beginners-to-learn-online-696379aa4e96)
* [Be certified CS Learner](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cs-fundamentals)
* [Learn CS fundaments](https://www.learncomputerscienceonline.com/)

</p>

> **After getting the crucial knowledge of CS fundamentals, Its time get proficient with programming and other skills.**
### 2. Learn how web works and Network security.

once you're done with Computer Science fundamentals. Learn about cryptography and steganography, Network security concepts like encryption, Decryption, Integrity, non-repudiation, and how a system can be hacked and spoofed by a non-ethical hacker and what measures should we use to minimize the risk of cyber attacks.

</p>


### 3. Learn basics of Blockchain
Once you're enough confident with your computer science fundamentals, now its time to dive deeper into the concepts of blockchain like what are **Smart Contract, DApps, DeFis, EVM chain, Distributed Ledger Technology, Hashing, Cryptography and etc.** You need to learn about Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crucial concepts such as public and private approaches, Decentralization, trustlessness, and etc. For this you can use various online courses and official documentation.

</p>


### 4. Learn about Smart Contracts and Solidity
> _**A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally-relevant events and actions according to the terms of contract or an agreement.**_
<p align="center">

</p>

_Using reference of [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp) "A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized **Blockchain** network."_

</p>


**Learn Solidity programming language in which Smart Contracts are mostly written for EVM compatible chains.** you can also learn blockchain for non-EVM compatible chains and for that u can use Solana and other **blockchains**. moreover if you wish to write Smart Contracts in other language then u can use Vyper as an alternative for **Solidity**, but solidity is more versatile and widely used.



### 5. Learn Web framework to make DApps
You can become a blockchain by only following the above written steps but if you wish to also run your app on the blockchain then you must learn **Web Development**. you should learn some basics for web development like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** I would highly suggest you to everyone reading this blog to learn JavaScript, because doing so will really help you to get more exposure in the field.

<p align="center">
  <img width="860" height="500" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664794807394/j3oq40DT7.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp">
</p>

Learn some framework based on JavaScript You can learn: React.js, Angular.js, learn some databases like MongoDB and for backend learn Node.js.
After following all the above steps, you're good to go!!

**Now the last but the most important step is:**

### 6. Make projects and Learn along with it.
Now as you've done with basic knowledge of blockchain, keep this in mind to follow project bases learning and make projects along with your learning journey to showcase yourself and your skills in the Tech Industry!

</p>
Join developer communities and being active in those will be really helpful!!
